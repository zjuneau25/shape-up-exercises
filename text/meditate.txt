What is Meditation?

Meditation is one path toward transforming the mind. Buddhist meditation practices encourage and develop concentration, clarity, and emotional positivity. When you begin a meditation practice, you may learn the patterns and habits of your mind. Meditation offers you a way to cultivate new and more positive ways to approach the things you do throughout your day. Meditation can have a transformative effect and can lead to positive changes as well as a new understanding of life.
